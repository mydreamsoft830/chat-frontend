                            We are a group of individuals who have created this platform to alert you when there's a price change on any product you place under our watch.

                        <h3>How do you compare prices?</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                            Itâ€™s simple. Paste a link to the product you want us to watch and set a desired price. Our web crawler will then monitors the link for any price change and then alerts you. Say for instance, you want to know when a product drops from $20 to $18. You paste the product link on our website and our website lets you know when the price hits $18.

                            We officially launched in the second half of 2019, but the concept has been cooking for a while.

                            Like everything else in life, we do have competition. However, there is nothing exactly like Wispri out there - we do believe that our offering stands apart because it is unique and designed to be convenient.

                            No, we don't. We only monitor the link that our users paste.
